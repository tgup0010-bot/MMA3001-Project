"""Compare environmental sensor readings against real BoM outdoor weather.

Keenan Granland's third EdStem suggestion ("irming scope #81"): pull in an
external dataset (he named BoM) to compare against the environmental
sensor readings. This only works for whichever sensor(s) actually overlap
BoM's fetchable date range (see occupancy.external_weather for why that
range is limited to a rolling ~15 months) -- this script checks every
sensor and reports which ones qualify, rather than assuming.

Usage:
    python scripts/fetch_bom_weather.py          # once, to get the data
    python scripts/weather_comparison_analysis.py
