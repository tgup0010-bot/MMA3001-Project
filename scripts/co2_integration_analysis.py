"""Accumulated CO2 exposure via Newton-Cotes integration (MMA3001 Week 6).

Computes total accumulated CO2 exposure (ppm.h) for sensor 6012002000326
two ways:

1. Trapezoidal integration directly on the raw, irregularly-spaced sensor
   readings -- honouring the true gap between each pair of readings
   (Week 6.1/7.1), rather than assuming a uniform sampling rate.
2. Trapezoidal and Simpson's 1/3 rule on regular grids at several bin
   sizes (matching scripts/sensitivity_analysis.py's own 5/15/30/60-minute
   sweep), to see how the accumulated estimate -- and the agreement
   between the two rules -- changes as sampling resolution changes
   (Week 6.2's refinement/convergence-evidence idea).

Usage:
    python scripts/co2_integration_analysis.py

    # --- 2. Regular-grid trapezoidal + Simpson, refining ONE fixed window ---
    #
    # A naive dropna() on the resampled series looks like a clean regular
    # grid but is not one: this sensor has real reporting outages (one gap
    # alone spans ~636 days), and dropna() silently concatenates readings
    # from either side of a gap as if they were one bin apart. That is
    # exactly the "pretend the spacing is uniform" mistake Week 6/7 warn
    # against -- caught here by Simpson and trapezoidal disagreeing wildly
    # on the naive version (Simpson is far more sensitive to a violated
    # uniform-spacing assumption than trapezoidal is).
    #
    # The fix has two parts. First, find one genuinely gap-free window at
    # the finest (15-min) resolution -- coarser bin sizes are then derived
    # from *that same window*, not from independently-chosen "longest run"
    # windows (which would each cover a different stretch of calendar
    # time, making a refinement comparison meaningless: halving h only
    # means something if both estimates approximate the same interval).
