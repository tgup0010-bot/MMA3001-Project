"""Fetch real Bureau of Meteorology daily weather observations for Moorabbin
Airport (station 086077, the nearest official BoM station to Monash
Clayton) -- external validation data for the environmental sensor log, per
Keenan Granland's third suggestion on the EdStem forum ("irming scope #81").

Important, honestly-scoped limitation: BoM's bulk historical-download
endpoint (Climate Data Online) actively blocks automated requests as
scraping (confirmed by testing against it -- it returns an explicit
"potential automated access" refusal). Their public monthly "Daily Weather
Observations" pages, however, are freely fetchable, but only for a rolling
window of roughly the last 15 months; anything older sits behind BoM's
paid/registered-access tier and is not fetched here. This means this
script can only ever cover recent months, not the full multi-year span of
the occupancy/environmental sensor data -- see docs/report/report.md for
which sensor this actually gives usable overlap with.

Usage:
    python scripts/fetch_bom_weather.py
