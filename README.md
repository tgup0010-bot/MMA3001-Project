# MMA3001 Project — Indoor CO2 Prediction

[![CI](https://github.com/tgup0010-bot/MMA3001-Project/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tgup0010-bot/MMA3001-Project/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Individual project for MMA3001 (Numerical Methods and Machine Learning), Monash University, 2026 S2.

## Engineering Problem

Indoor CO2 rises when rooms are occupied and ventilation is insufficient. Above 800–1000 ppm, occupants experience reduced alertness. Most building systems react *after* CO2 is already too high.

This project predicts CO2 concentration **15 minutes ahead** from recent sensor history, so a building management system can pre-emptively increase ventilation. It also runs a full zone-matching analysis to test whether occupancy data is useful — and finds that it is not, for this sensor.

**Status: complete.** All four Week 5 regression methods are implemented and compared. A Week 6 numerical integration analysis is included. The full written report is at [`docs/report/report.md`](docs/report/report.md) and [`docs/report/MMA3001_Project_Report.docx`](docs/report/MMA3001_Project_Report.docx).

## Results

**Best model: SVR** — MAE 8.35 ppm, R² 0.342 on the held-out test set (chronological split, cutoff 11 March 2026).

| Model | MAE (ppm) | RMSE (ppm) | R² |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 9.012 | 25.579 | 0.3581 |
| Decision Tree Regression | 9.353 | 28.708 | 0.1914 |
| **SVR** | **8.350** | 25.894 | 0.3422 |
| Neural Network Regression | 9.350 | 26.015 | 0.3360 |

**Occupancy does not help.** Adding building occupancy as a feature makes no meaningful difference for any model (and actively hurts Decision Tree). This is explained by the zone-matching analysis below.

## Zone-Matching Analysis (Keena's Weekend Spike Method)

Before using occupancy as a feature, a dedicated analysis tested whether sensor `6012002000326` is physically located in any of the 5 monitored occupancy zones. Method: on weekends, when only one zone is occupied, CO2 should spike by 50–200 ppm at a co-located sensor.

Run on the full 9-million-row occupancy dataset:

| Zone | CO2 delta (solo-occupied weekends) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Zone A | +6.2 ppm | Physically negligible — not co-located |
| Zone B | −1.4 ppm | Not co-located |
| Zone C | +1.8 ppm | Not co-located |
| Zone D | −5.3 ppm | Not co-located |

Expected if co-located: 50–200 ppm. All zone-CO2 Pearson correlations are also negative (r ≈ −0.14 to −0.17), consistent with HVAC dilution rather than co-location. **Sensor 0326 is not in any monitored room.**

## Data

Source: MMA3001 Dataset 2 (Monash Smart Infrastructure Occupancy and Environmental Data).

**Only 1 of the 5 sensors used** (`6012002000326`):
- 2 sensors have frozen clocks (all readings same timestamp — not usable)
- 1 sensor only has ~4 months of data
- Sensor 0326 chosen and validated against Bureau of Meteorology records: r = +0.84 (temperature), r = +0.65 (humidity) over 222 days

**17,010 rows used** from 84,576 candidates — 80% dropped due to a 636-day sensor outage and missing lag/rolling features.

Raw data files are not committed (see [`data/raw/README.md`](data/raw/README.md)).
