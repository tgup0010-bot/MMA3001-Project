"""Newton-Cotes numerical integration of CO2 concentration over time.

Applies MMA3001 Week 6's integration methods to a genuine engineering
question: how much CO2 has *accumulated* over a period, not just what its
instantaneous level was? This mirrors Week 6's own framing exactly --
"engineering instruments commonly record local or instantaneous values
rather than the total quantity required for a decision" -- CO2 sensors
report a concentration at an instant, but the exposure-relevant quantity
(e.g. for ventilation-adequacy assessment) is its time integral.

Formulas match MMA3001 Week 6.1 / 6.2 exactly:

    Q_trap = sum_i (x[i+1] - x[i]) * (f[i] + f[i+1]) / 2
    Q_simpson = (h/3) * [f0 + 4*sum(odd) + 2*sum(even) + fn]   (equal spacing only)

Both are implemented directly (not via scipy) so the calculation is
auditable against the taught formulas.
