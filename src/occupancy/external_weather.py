"""Loading of real Bureau of Meteorology daily weather observations.

External validation data for the environmental sensor log, per Keenan
Granland's third suggestion on the EdStem forum ("irming scope #81"): does
a sensor's reading make sense against real outdoor weather for the same
days?

Data source and its real limitation
------------------------------------
Files are BoM's public monthly "Daily Weather Observations" CSVs for
Moorabbin Airport (station 086077 -- the nearest official BoM station to
Monash Clayton), fetched by :mod:`scripts.fetch_bom_weather`. BoM's bulk
historical-download endpoint (Climate Data Online) actively blocks
automated requests as scraping; only a rolling ~15-month window of recent
months is fetchable this way. This means comparisons using this module can
only ever cover recent months (see the project report for exactly which
environmental sensor has usable overlap), not the full multi-year span of
the occupancy/environmental sensor data -- an honest constraint of the
data source, not a shortcut taken in this code.
