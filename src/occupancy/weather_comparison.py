"""Compare one environmental sensor's readings against real outdoor weather.

Sanity-checks an indoor sensor against BoM's real Moorabbin Airport
observations for the same days: does the sensor's temperature/humidity
plausibly track outdoor conditions (as any real, working indoor sensor
subject to some outdoor influence should), or is it disconnected from
reality (suggesting a faulty sensor)? This is Keenan Granland's third
EdStem suggestion ("irming scope #81") -- pulling in an external dataset
for comparison -- applied to whichever sensor actually has overlapping
dates with BoM's fetchable window (see
:mod:`occupancy.external_weather` for why that window is limited, and the
project report for which sensor qualifies).

This is a plausibility check, not a validation of accuracy: a real indoor
sensor is expected to correlate with outdoor weather only loosely (a
climate-controlled building deliberately dampens the outdoor swing), so a
moderate positive correlation is the expected, healthy result -- not
evidence of anything being "wrong".
